- [What is Grafana?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafana) - Grafana is a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application. It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources. As a visualization tool, Grafana is a popular component in monitoring stacks, often used in combination with time series databases such as InfluxDB, Prometheus and Graphite, monitoring platforms such as Sensu, Icinga, Checkmk,[10] Zabbix, Netdata,[7] and PRTG; SIEMs such as Elasticsearch[6] and Splunk; and other data sources. The Grafana user interface was originally based on version 3 of Kibana.
